							<p><em>Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle / I want to ride my bicycle, bicycle, bicycle / I want to ride my bicycle / I want to ride my bike / I want to ride my bicycle / I want to ride it where I like</em> - Bicycle Race by Queen</p>
							<p><em><strong>BonnyBike</strong></em> was founded in 2017 by <strong>Gareth Williams</strong> and <strong>Saoirse McGregor</strong>, two fellow students of the School of Computing Science of the University of Glasgow who wanted to make a business out of their 2 passions: Cycling and Glasgow. 
							Since Glasgow has long been an established vibrant cycling city where cycling is accessible, safe and attractive to all, creating a business that moves the mentality of the citizens 
							towards the same direction that has made Glasgow see surge in people taking up cycling in the last decade, we believe we continue this growth well into the present and the future.</p>
